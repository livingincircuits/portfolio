Getting that invisible work optimised will make it easier to do a good job and produce reliable results promptly.</p>\n<h3>Scale and speed up our operations - We want to scale up our research, so we are gathering insights based on evidence whilst speeding up our more tactical activities such as validation</h3>\n<p>If we are going to move up the maturity model and be leading, we need a framework around our work that is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reusable</li>\n<li>Structured</li>\n<li>Scalable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An insights framework will allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Record and properly categorise research</li>\n<li>Search in an easy but flexible manner</li>\n<li>Discover patterns</li>\n<li>Support an evidence-based approach</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Democratise user understanding - We want to empower everyone to discover UX research, remix existing research, and share their own user stories</h3>\n<p>We want to be able to find out the what by collecting objective on-site metrics showing us how our users behave. We can discover the why by following up and collecting richer, descriptive data which tells us why users are behaving in that way.</p>\n<p>This will put us in a strong position where we can identify where there may be pain points within user journeys, why users experience these pain points and how it might affect their experience.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We presented the strategy to the leadership team and was very well received. A lot of what is in this strategy has been implemented successfully.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Growing UX Research","date":"01.02.2022","customer":"Sky Betting & Gaming","task":"Lead UX Researcher","company":"Developed for Sky Betting & Gaming","activities":"Nurturing UX Research","when":"2022","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/8275e/s-screen.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/e3903/s-screen.jpg 480w,\n/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/8275e/s-screen.jpg 900w","srcWebp":"/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/cd91b/s-screen.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/61162/s-screen.webp 480w,\n/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/cd91b/s-screen.webp 900w","sizes":"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/b0d7055d317a4ff8a3159cffd73eabe1/a6c62/s-screen.jpg"}}},"landscape":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAJABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAABBf/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB5iCJ2jZVV//EABgQAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhMy/9oACAEBAAEFAtaW5PKY8N//xAAWEQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEDH/2gAIAQMBAT8BNX//xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIDIf/aAAgBAgEBPwHRuuFH/8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAAhJx/9oACAEBAAY/Aps24wv/xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABExQRD/2gAIAQEAAT8h6FQKswQJKTZz73//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEAM//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQMBAT8QUf/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAgEBPxAjFkf/xAAcEAEAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABExYXEhobH/2gAIAQEAAT8QqbBDL2Pj7Q67cfN3wXFlBHkm+k9w+zR1P//Z","aspectRatio":2.341463414634146,"src":"/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/74fd5/s-landscape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/e3903/s-landscape.jpg 480w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/b31d1/s-landscape.jpg 960w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/74fd5/s-landscape.jpg 1920w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/c1679/s-landscape.jpg 2880w","srcWebp":"/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/6833b/s-landscape.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/61162/s-landscape.webp 480w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/596e5/s-landscape.webp 960w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/6833b/s-landscape.webp 1920w,\n/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/5c931/s-landscape.webp 2880w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/c79e4b9431ac361774bdd7cd71626ba1/a6c62/s-landscape.jpg"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/growing-ux-research","sourceInstanceName":"projects"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/growing-ux-research","left":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/sky-bet-italia"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sky Bet Italia","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/81d3c1fd4bbdebb55bff7a73cc2459bc/4fe8c/it-screen.jpg"}}},"landscape":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/172665bba74e994bcbce96518ae264ff/4fe8c/it-landscape.jpg"}}}}},"right":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/embedding-ucd"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Embedding UCD","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/a5130741f1956921c7b431780747c89f/4fe8c/wp-screen.jpg"}}},"landscape":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/736ee1ba38fd9212648c8f3aceda5157/4fe8c/wp-landscape.jpg"}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
