Why would you even? It doesn't work and means users will miss some of your content. I use a track pad and I have lost count of how many times I have scrolled right past some content.</li>\n<li><strong>Hiding UI behind hover states.</strong> (HELLO TOUCH?) You can't hover with a finger. It's not difficult to bind states.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult Online Forms.</strong> Inline validation isn't hard. Asking me for every detail about my life is over intrusive. What are you doing with these details exactly? Keep it simple.</li>\n<li><strong>Overcommercialisation of the Web.</strong> Pop ups, Pop ups everywhere!</li>\n<li><strong>Playing videos automatically.</strong> OMG I am at work and now everyone knows I am watching kitty videos.</li>\n<li><strong>Playing music automatically.</strong> Nobody needs to hear how bad some of the music I listen to is.</li>\n<li><strong>Bad Performance.</strong> Oh you like to show 2mb pretty images. Thanks. Oh wait, I can't see them as your website is taking 2 minutes to load. Bye.</li>\n<li><strong>Hamburger nav.</strong> I just want to see where I might go but you've stolen this decision from me and made it that little bit harder to find where I might want to go. And now I am leaving your website forever. Stop hiding everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Rubbish breakpoints.</strong> Oh you've gone responsive? That's great! Oh wait, you didn't check my particular resolution and created breakpoints based on popular devices? Not so great.</li>\n<li><strong>jQuery Mobile.</strong> Absolutely nothing else to say.</li>\n<li><strong>Light grey text on white background.</strong> I hate this. I seriously hate this and the designers that do this. You are destroying my eye sight.</li>\n<li><strong>Centre aligning text everywhere.</strong> Yeah not reading that content.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive line length.</strong> I hate this one too. Absolutely killing my eyes and gives me a massive headache from eye strain.</li>\n<li><strong>Social media icons everywhere!</strong> Stop begging to be liked. Stopping begging to be followed. It's weird.</li>\n<li><strong>Unskippable ads.</strong> This isn't cool at all. Do you not want people to visit your website?</li>\n<li><strong>Homepage carousels.</strong> There is so much more you could do with this valuable real estate.</li>\n<li><strong>Captchas.</strong> The lazy developers dream but every users nightmare. Stop using them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am irritated an awful lot on the web these days and I feel like my irritations are usually a lack of attention to detail or lack of funds. Neither is a very good excuse to making your websites difficult and annoying to use. Fight for the user.</p>\n<p>You might be thinking that a lot of these issues are purely personal preferences and certainly some are but I bet if you asked your users what irritates them about your website, some of these will appear.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"I've recently noticed that as a front end developer, i'm liking working with the web much more but as a user, I am constantly irritated by aâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Ruin An Experience","date":"06.
