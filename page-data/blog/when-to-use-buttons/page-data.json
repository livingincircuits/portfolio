The button element was introduced to HTML as an alternative to inputs as they are easier to style. By default, a buttons type is set to submit like so <code>&#x3C;button type=\"submit\">Submit button&#x3C;/button></code>.</p>\n<p>When you have an action on the page and you need an element to trigger that action, rather than using an empty link, use a <code>&#x3C;button></code>. If you need to link somewhere, say to another page or a website use <code>&#x3C;a href=\"#\">&#x3C;/a></code> but for everything else, both <code>&#x3C;button></code> and <code>&#x3C;input></code> are perfectly valid so which you choose is down to personal preference and is less about semantics at this point.</p>\n<h2>Styling?</h2>\n<p>There are styling differences between buttons and inputs but I suggest you read this <a href=\"http://nickcowie.com/presentation/s5-button.html\">presentation from Nick Cowie</a> for more information on that.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"When to use a button is often confusing for beginners and advanced HTML authors alike.
