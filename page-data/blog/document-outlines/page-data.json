It helps people to visually navigate through your content.</p>\n<p>I'm not going to touch upon the HTML5 outline algorithm here as it isn't quite there in terms of support. We are still being advised to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#rank\">use headings to convey document structure.</a></p>\n<h2>Structure over style</h2>\n<p>It isn't uncommon to come across designers and developers who don't understand that HTML headings indicate structure, not style. Assistive technologies use HTML headings as a page outline and allows users to navigate through your content. Additionally, your outline can be parsed by a machine like a search engine to improve search results.</p>\n<p>Headings tend to be chosen for style purposes, without paying any attention to semantics. Time and client restrictions are usually the best excuses for this and I am no exception. I almost always try and create useful page outlines whilst I am building a project but I am aware that clients may break away from this on a content managed website.</p>\n<p>Creating useful page outlines on a content managed website can be difficult but not impossible. Educating a client about structure and hierarchy is the first step. Sometimes it can be difficult to explain that headings are not just for styling purposes but working with them to introduce a working hierarchy is often the best approach.</p>\n<h2>Fixing Your Document Outlines</h2>\n<p>I have collated a lovely succinct list of things to do or not do for the time poor among us. Keep in mind that sometimes a design will dictate what you can do. It's your job to dance around these issues and try to keep the user in mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have already built your project, then the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo/related\">HTML5 Outliner tool</a> from the Chrome store will be useful. This quick test will indicate if there is room for improvement in your markup and an opportunity to create more useful page structures.</li>\n<li>Don't use HTML headings to dictate visual appearance.</li>\n<li>Don't skip any level of heading. Eg: H1, H3, H4 etc.</li>\n<li>Provide a logical heading structure.</li>\n<li>Your webpage should have at least have one H1 and it should represent the title of the page.</li>\n<li>The H1 of your webpage should be at the beginning of the main content.</li>\n<li>The primary and/or secondary navigations on your webpage can have headings but should be below the level of your main heading. Your main heading should be a H1 so follow the same logic and make your navigation headings a H2.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that assistive technologies are able to navigate heading markup which can be an effective way for users to more quickly find content of interest.</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Every Web page has a document outline and it is created by your headings, table titles, form titles etc. The document outline is theâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Document Outlines","date":"06.
