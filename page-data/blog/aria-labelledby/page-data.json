It's used to associate a group of elements, or to establish a relationship between groups. It's function works similar to the alt and title attributes.</p>\n<p>Semantic markup is always preferred over ARIA misuse. With that said, it isn't always possible to access the markup in certain situations so <code>aria-labelledby</code> is essential for letting a screenreader know what your intent is.</p>\n<p>The example below uses the <code>aria-labelledby</code> property to indicate where the section's title is. The value must match the id of the element that contains the <code>&#x3C;section></code> title</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;section aria-labelledby=\"section-heading\">\r\n    &#x3C;h2 id=\"section-heading\">I am a title&#x3C;/h2>\r\n    &#x3C;article role=\"article\">\r\n        I am a some article text\r\n    &#x3C;/article>     \r\n&#x3C;/section>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another example would be to associate titles with lists. Often lists will be preceded by a title but the two are unrelated. <strong>Labelledby</strong> provides more contextual information to users when they are navigating the page.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;h3 id=\"colours\">Colours of the rainbow&#x3C;/h3>\r\n&#x3C;ul aria-labelledby=\"colours\">\r\n  &#x3C;li>Red&#x3C;/li>\r\n  &#x3C;li>Yellow&#x3C;/li>\r\n  &#x3C;li>Pink&#x3C;/li>\r\n  &#x3C;li>Green&#x3C;/li>\r\n&#x3C;/ul>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Example scenarios</h2>\n<p>These are only a few examples of what you would use <code>aria-labelledby</code> for in the wild.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When used in a form context, the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute replaces the associated label element.
