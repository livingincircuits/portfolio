They will walkthrough user scenarios following the \"perfect path\" and check the communication between the UI and the user. The evaluation is based on cognitive psychology — how people learn.</p>\n<p>Cognitive Walkthroughs are a cost-effective way to gather fast feedback and insights prior to product development. They are also useful for when you don't have immediate access to users.</p>\n<h2>The four questions to be asked during a Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>\n<p>Blackmon, Polson, et al. in 2002 in their paper <a href=\"http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~blackmon/Papers/BlackmonEtAlCHI2002.pdf\">Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web</a> offer four questions to be used by an assessor during a Cognitive Walkthrough:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?</li>\n<li>Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?</li>\n<li>Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they expect to achieve?</li>\n<li>If the correct action is performed; will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conducting a Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose which tasks that you would like to evaluate.</li>\n<li>Determine the persona whose cognitive functions are relevant for these tasks.</li>\n<li>Break the tasks down into individual steps to create our \"happy path\" and write a script for the journey.</li>\n<li>For every step in the task, you ask the four questions. You do this before, during and after each step.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Who should conduct a Cognitive Walkthrough?</h2>\n<p>Anyone can conduct a Cognitive Walkthrough; however, it is often better to conduct a Cognitive Walkthrough with people who are not already familiar with your UI. This is due to the fact that they are likely to miss things.</p>\n<h2>I've conducted a Cognitive Walkthrough, now what?</h2>\n<p>I usually collate all the reports together and share these with the team, then bring everyone together for a brainstorming session in order to determine and prioritise solutions.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"What is a Cognitive Walkthrough?
