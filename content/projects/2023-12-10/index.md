## 1) Executive Summary

I reset how Product, Design, and Research worked together by introducing a lightweight intake + alignment workflow and outcome-based framing, increasing clarity on what research is for and how it drives business decisions.  

**My Role:** Lead UX Researcher, strategic partner to Product and Design; created the operating mechanisms and coached teams on how to engage with UXR.  

**The Team:** Cross-functional partnership with Product Managers, Designers, and (as needed) Engineering stakeholders through structured alignment conversations.

## 2) Challenge & Context

**Problem space:** The organisation had a gap in shared understanding of UXR’s role and value in the product development process. The default mode was misalignment and inconsistent engagement, which created friction and reduced the impact of insights. 

**Why it mattered now:** Without alignment, research risks becoming a “deliverable factory” rather than a decision-support function. That leads to wasted cycles, unclear priorities, and lower confidence in product direction.

**Research goals:**

- Understand prior experiences (good and bad) with research and what “impact” looked like to stakeholders.
- Identify barriers to integrating research into workflows and decision-making.
- Learn preferred formats and engagement models for insights so research could land effectively.

**Constraints:**

- Teams were still new to user research, so I needed simple, repeatable structures (templates) rather than heavyweight process.
- Compliance and participant-data risk needed to be handled explicitly through policy and governance (consent, retention, tool compliance, ethics, inclusivity).

### 3) Strategic Approach & Methodology

**Method selection:**  

I chose **stakeholder interviews** as the core method because the bottleneck was not “lack of user data”, it was **alignment, trust, and adoption of research in product decision-making**. Stakeholder interviews let me diagnose the collaboration system and redesign it based on real constraints and incentives.

**Participant strategy:**  

I spoke with stakeholders across Product and Design to capture:

- Past experiences and pain points.
- Barriers to acting on research.
- What “evidence” and “good collaboration” meant to each group.

**Lead-level scaling move:**  

Instead of relying on individual heroics, I created reusable mechanisms:

- A **Stakeholder Requirements Gathering Document** to standardise project intake, hypotheses, research questions, and learning outcomes.
- A **business-outcome-to-research-goals translation approach** so research planning started from measurable outcomes, not feature requests.
- A **foundation** that built compliance and ethics into how we work (consent, retention, inclusive research, tool compliance).

## 4) The “Messy Middle”

**Stakeholder alignment:**  

I ran structured conversations with stakeholders using a consistent interview guide, explicitly setting expectations:

- I asked for honest feedback.
- I requested consent to record so I could focus on listening.
- I committed to sharing outputs in synthesised form to reduce fear of “direct quoting” and increase openness.

**How I navigated ambiguity:**  

I treated the engagement as a system problem:

- Diagnose friction points (perceptions, barriers, communication breakdowns).
- Synthesise themes into opportunities.
- Use that to propose a revised collaboration strategy and keep iterating with check-ins.

**Synthesis**  

I focused synthesis on actionable themes:

- Where research was failing to influence decisions.
- What stakeholders needed to trust findings.
- What formats and cadences would make insights usable in real product cycles.

I applied this approach on a team by team basis as there are many teams and this way I could learn and continue to develop the process over time. 

## 5) Insights & Actionable Recommendations

**Key “Aha” themes:**

1. **Research value was not consistently understood**, so buy-in depended on individual relationships rather than a shared model.
2. **Teams needed clarity at project start**: hypotheses, questions, and expected learning outcomes, in plain language.
3. **Research needed to be anchored in business outcomes**, not outputs, so prioritisation and impact were legible.
4. **Trust required governance**: clear consent, retention, and tool compliance reduced organisational risk and made research easier to scale.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement a standardised intake template for every research project to force early alignment on hypotheses, questions, and learning outcomes.
- Start research planning from business outcomes and translate them into product outcomes and research goals.
- Establish baseline research policies (consent, retention, inclusive research, ethical research, tool compliance) to reduce risk and speed up execution.

## 6) Business Impact & Outcomes

**Business impact:**

- Reduced wasted effort by aligning on research goals upfront (fewer late-stage pivots and fewer “can you also test…” scope creep moments).
- Increased adoption of insights by tailoring communication and engagement preferences.
- Reduced compliance risk and time-to-approve research by having policies ready.

**Product influence:**  

We shifted from feature-led requests to outcome-led research goals.

- The project highlighted that research maturity is as much about **operating mechanisms and influence** as it is about methods.
- Formalising intake + governance was a force multiplier that helped the team engage with research consistently, not episodically.
